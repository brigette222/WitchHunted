# Witch Hunted Prototype (Work in Progress)

This game was my first larger project in Unity and has served as an experimental space for learning and iteration. The project works but is still in the middle of development, as I continue refining and testing different mechanics. At this stage,
itâ€™s a very unedited version, with some values still needing adjustment and many elements pre-optimization. I am also in the process of cleaning up unnecessary files and streamlining the project. This repository reflects my process of learning 
through building and experimenting. In the coming weeks, I will also be working on and uploading additional small 3D and VR games that are closely aligned with the type of work being done at D&D Skunkworks.
