This game was my first larger project in Unity and has served as an experimental space for learning and iteration. The project works but is still in the middle of development, as I've been refining and testing different mechanics. At this stage, itâ€™s a very unedited 
version, with some values still needing adjustment and many elements pre-optimization/under construction. This repository reflects my process of learning through building and experimenting. 

The game itself can be played by starting either the "MainMenu" or "DeepForest" scene. Both of these scenes can be located In the "scenes" folder under assets.


In the coming weeks, I'll continue optimizing this game. I'll also be working on and uploading additional small 3D and VR games.
