You place the incense, the talisman, and a lock of your own hair on the earth.
Smoke rises — thin, silver — carrying the old words skyward.
You move through the ritual steps, slow and deliberate, tracing the path of those who came before you.
At the final step, the charm in your hand stirs. Small lights lift from it — flickering, fragile — and drift upward into the mist.
You feel them. The ones you've lost.
But something in the earth remains heavy.
You listen carefully for a moment, and then you realize - not all have answered. Not all have moved on.
Some are still bound to this world — by breath, by blood. Your people are alive.
A tremor passes through you.

You step forward into the unknown, and for the first time since this entire ordeal started, hope follows.
